## What is Django?
Django is a Python web framework that makes building websites fast and easy, handling many complex tasks so you can focus on your app.

## How to Install Django
1. **Set Up a Virtual Environment :** (optional but recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv myenv
   source myenv/bin/activate  
   # On Windows: myenv\Scripts\activate
   ```
**Install Django :**
```
pip install django
```
## Creating a New Project :
To start a new Django project, run this command:
```
django-admin startproject myproject
```
This creates a folder named myproject with all the necessary files.<br>or you can give your folder name whatever you want to.

## Creating an App :
An app is a part of your project. To create a new app, go to your project folder and run:

```
cd myproject
python manage.py startapp myapp
```
## Working with Models :
Models are like blueprints for your data. They define what your data looks like. You create them in the models.py file of your app.

```
from django.db import models
```
Ex:-
```
class Department(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=50)
```

## Creating Views :
Views handle what users see when they visit your site. You create them in the views.py file.
```
from django.http import HttpResponse
```
Ex:-
```
def home(request):
    return HttpResponse("Welcome to the home page!")
```

## Setting Up URLs :
URLs connect web addresses to views. You set this up in the urls.py file.
```
from django.urls import path
from . import views
urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.home, name='home'),
]
```
## Using the Admin Panel :
Django has a built-in admin panel to manage your models easily. Register your models in the admin.py file.
```
from django.contrib import admin
from .models import Department

admin.site.register(Department)
```
## Using Serializers :
Serializers allow you to convert complex data types, like querysets, into JSON and vice versa. For example, you can create a serializer for the Department model.
```
from rest_framework import serializers
from .models import Department

class DepartmentSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Department
        fields = '__all__'
```
## Running the Server :
To see your app in action, start the development server with:

```
python manage.py runserver
Then go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in your web browser.
```

## Making Changes to the Database :
When you change your models, you need to update the database. Run these commands:
```
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```
after migrate, run the server again.<br><br>
## Testing Your App :
Django makes it easy to test your app. Write tests in the tests.py file.
```
from django.test import TestCase

class SimpleTest(TestCase):
    def test_home_page(self):
        response = self.client.get('/')
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)
```
## Useful Scripts :
You can create scripts to automate tasks. For example, a script to update student records based on their teachers might look like this:
```
 scripts/demo.py
 #give the command according to your scripts file name
from myapp.models import Student, Teacher

def update_student_info():
    students = Student.objects.all()
    
    for student in students:
        teacher = student.employee_id
        if teacher and teacher.department_id:
            student.department_id = teacher.department_id
            if teacher.department_id.school_id:
                student.school_id = teacher.department_id.school_id
            student.save()
            print(f'Updated student {student.roll_no} with department {student.department_id.name}.')
        else:
            print(f'Student {student.roll_no} has no associated teacher.')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    update_student_info()
```

## Installed Apps 
Make sure to include the following apps in your `settings.py:`

```
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'Department',
    'School',
    'django_extensions',
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'myapp',
    'Department',
    'School',
]
```
Note:- Install whatever  app you created.
